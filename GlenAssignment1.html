    <h1>A Review of Access to Archival Databases</h1>
     
      
    <h2>System Introduction:</h2>
      <ul>
       <li>Access to Archival Databases <a href="https://aad.archives.gov/aad/">(AAD)</a> is an online research tool created by the National Archives and Records Administration <a href="https://www.archives.gov/">(NARA)</a>, a governmental record keeping organization of the United States.</li>
       <li>NARA is known as the nation's record keeper and has a mission to protect, preserve, and share government records that tells the stories of our national history, our government, and of the lives of individual Americans.</li>
       <li>AAD is a search engine that allows users access to some of NARA's electronic records.</li>
       <li>System specification: As a research tool created by NARA, AAD's mission is to allow online researchers access to electronic records and archival series information. Through the use of a search engine which searches and retrieves user input information, users can find content using the selection of topics or varying levels of specified searches.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Users:</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>Geneological researchers can access immigration, civilian, military, war, or death record information. Photograph indexes may also be useful to geneological researchers.</li>
      <li>Government focused researchers can access information about the private sector (businesses, foundations, labor unions, or securities), places (countries, states, counties, cities/towns, and zip codes) as well as government spending records.</li>
      <li>Historians who are interested in researching the lives of Americans accross history will benefit from geneological and war and international relations information. Historians with an interest in government history will benefit from local and national record information.</li>
      <li>Anyone interested in researching additional topics not on the home page such as disease, disasters, education, and historic preservation.</li>
      <li>International researchers interested in learning about the lives of Americans, American history, and the American government.</li>
     </ul>

    <h2>Content:</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>Geneological records including casualty, civilian, military, immigrant, and war records.</li>
      <li>Indexes that help users access information on where to find photographs and textual records.</li>
      <li>Private sector records on businesses, foundations, labor unions and securities.</li>
      <li>Places records include information about countries, states, counties, cities/towns, and zip codes.</li>
      <li>War/International Relations records include information from the Civil War, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Cold War, and diplomatic records.</li>
      <li>Government spending records show information on contracts, grants, and assistance.</li>
      <li>Time span categories allow users to search back to records from 1800.</li>
      <li>The content categories mentioned above are the main categories listed on AAD's home page. By selecting "Browse by Subject", researchers can find more content ranging from disease to ship passenger records.</li>
      <li>Content includes series information, electronic records, and indexes on where to find photographs and textual records.</li>
      <li>AAD is a sizable repository with 66 series, 350+ data files, and more than 50 million records.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Discussion:</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>AAD is very user-friendly to users of all researh background levels and understanding of how to search for information.</li>
      <li>While using and exploring the site, it was clear to me that this was a nicely designed site with a clear requirement analysis/determination with user needs in mind and clearly defined tasks and content.</li>
      <li>It was also clear to me when using this site that HCI was taken into account. From ease of use to quick response times, good interaction efficiency, and ease of navigation, this site is very helpful in gathering useful information. The color choices, occasional use of pictures, and being a research tool created by NARA makes this site visually appealing and trustworthy.</li>
      <li>Pros: The search interface and HCI elements makes this site simple and effective to use.</li>
      <li>Cons: If a researcher would like to see a digitized copy of a document or photograph, they will not find it on this site.</li>
      <li>Suggestions: NARA could improve AAD by providing digitized copies of records and photographs. Not everyone can physically travel to NARA, and even if people can travel, records of visitor interest may be off site. Additionally, NARA should let researchers know if an original copy no longer exists.</li>
     </ul>
